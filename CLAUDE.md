# CEO or CTO

## Project Overview

A web application inspired by the original Facemash, but instead of comparing attractiveness, users compare two people to determine which one looks more like a CEO vs. a CTO.

## Concept

The application presents users with two photos side-by-side and asks: "Who's the CEO?" or "Who's the CTO?" Users click on one of the two images to make their selection.

## The Interesting Part

The humor and insight of this project comes from the fact that:

1. **Most CTOs look like CTOs** - There's often a recognizable "technical founder" aesthetic
2. **Most CEOs look like CEOs** - Similarly, there's a recognizable "business leader" aesthetic
3. **Rankings will reveal extremes**:
   - The **CEO who looks most like a CTO** (business leader with strong technical vibes)
   - The **CTO who looks most like a CEO** (technical leader with strong business vibes)

This creates an amusing commentary on stereotypes in the tech industry while generating interesting data about how people perceive founder roles based on appearance.
